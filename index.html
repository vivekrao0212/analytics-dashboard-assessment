        <p>The electric vehicle (EV) population in Washington State has been growing rapidly, driven by state incentives,
          environmental policies, and consumer demand. Washington consistently ranks among the top states in the U.S. for
          EV adoption, with a focus on reducing emissions and supporting clean energy. EV adoption varies significantly by
          county, influenced by factors such as population density, income levels, and charging infrastructure.
          <br>From the bar chart we can see that King county has the highest concentration of EVs followed by Clark.
          <br>Other counties of wasington state are not that rich in electric vehicles.

        <p><b>BEVs</b> are fully electric vehicles powered solely by batteries, with no internal combustion engine. These
          vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions.
          <br><br><b>PHEVs</b> are vehicles that have both an internal combustion engine and an electric battery. They can
          run on electric power alone for short distances and switch to gasoline for longer trips, making them more
          flexible than BEVs.

        <p>Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility refers to the qualification of vehicles to be recognized as
          clean fuel vehicles that use alternative, non-petroleum-based fuels. These vehicles often qualify for various
          incentives, tax credits, or exemptions designed to promote the adoption of greener transportation options. The
          eligibility criteria for CAFVs depend on the specific state or federal programs and the type of alternative fuel
          the vehicle uses.</p>
